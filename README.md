# react-employeeDb

## Overview
    This application is an example of a dashboard for viewing an employee database. The user can easily see each employee, their name, age and where they live. The user can also filter employees based on where they live. 

## Usage
    When a user comes to the main page they are presented with a list of all the employees with their pictures and basic information. If the user wants to filter the data they can click on the filter link in the navbar and search a USA state and employees will be filtered accordingly.
    This app is still in developement and still needs to by styled and refractored. The sorting is not currently functional and the data is relatively incomplete. 

## Technologies
    React was used to create the UI and render the data.
    Data was produced by a random user API but is stored the same as a Mongo DB would store data, as JSON objects.

## Deployment
    The app is functional and runs with no errors, however, the user is not able to sort data.
